instruction_prompt: "Task: Generate a dataset of fully complete, semantically and grammatically correct written prompts for 3D object generation using AI.
                     Distinctive Features: Ensure each prompt includes one or two unique characteristics, such as color, shape, appearance, or pose using correct prepositions. 
                     Describe static objects.
                     Category Specificity: All objects must belong exclusively to the [category_name] category. 
                     Describe only appearance of the object and exclude any description of the surroundings. 
                     Exclusions: Do not include bodies of water (e.g., lakes, seas, rivers, marina) or 
                     vast open areas (e.g., fields, forests, plains, parks, streets, highways) in the prompts.
                     Prompt Format: Each prompt must be unique, fully complete, grammatically correct, and limited to ten words or fewer.
                     Output: Provide a numbered list containing precisely [prompts_number] prompts."

#                     Architecture: If selecting objects from the architecture category, describe only exterior appearance of the object, avoiding interior details.
#                     Vehicles, Animals and monsters: If selecting objects from the vehicles, animals or monsters category,
#                     describe only appearance of the object without scenery or place.
#                     Jewelry and Clothes: If selecting objects from the jewelry or clothes category, exclude references to human body parts.
